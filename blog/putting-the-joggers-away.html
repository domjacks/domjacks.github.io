                in my <a href="doing-less.html">last post</a> i talked about my main new year's resolution for work of
                doing less. but i also have another, even simpler one. and it's already done me a world of good and is
                much easier to measure. but first, a little bit of background...
            </p>
            <p>
                since near the start of the pandemic in the uk, i've been working from home. and with that has come a
                huge change in my habits. one of them for example, is that i no longer needed to get properly dressed in
                the morning. as i wasn't heading into a place with other humans that i worked with, i have been able to
                slip further and further away from what most would consider, clothes suitable for the outside world.
            </p>
            <p>
                now i never went as far as working in my pyjamas or underwear. but i definitely started to put less and
                less effort into what i wore whilst working from home. i opted for comfier clothes, optimising for
                function over fashion.
            </p>
            <p>
                but in this, i think lost something. i can't quite put my finger on what. but there's a mental switch
                that gets flicked as soon as i put jeans or trousers on. there's an attitude change that occurs when i
                shave and do my hair. it made me feel more awake, attentive, engaged and generally less slobbish. it
                also helped with the separation between work and home.
            </p>
            <p>
                so with that i decided to put the joggers away this year.
