            i know, i know, i’m a little late to the party on this one. but it’s something i’ve been meaning to do
            for a while now.
        </p>
        <p>
            if you don’t know what a /now page is, i definitely recommend having a look through the original blog
            post by derek sivers. you can also find a list of /now pages that other people have created and how to
            get started with your own over at <a href="https://nownownow.com">https://nownownow.com</a>.
        </p>

            as a concept, it’s a great way for people to find out what you’re currently up to. but also, given my
            site is all in vcs, it can act as a personal log of what I’m up to at a given time.
        </p>

            this last year of the pandemic has meant it’s been increasingly difficult to keep people in the loop as
            to your personal and professional circumstances. i find the idea of having a quick summary online very
            appealing. now if only my family would accept a link as opposed to a phone call… I joke of course, keep
            in touch with your family, people!
        </p>
        <p>
            some of this is in reaction to deleting my linkedin account last year and attempting to bolster my
            presence on my own website as opposed to social media and other services. ideally, I’d like to go full
            <a href="https://indieweb.org/">indieweb</a> one day, but alas other things get in the way…
