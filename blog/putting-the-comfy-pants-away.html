            since near the start of the pandemic in the uk i, like a lot of people, been working from home. and over the course of the two or so years I have changed my daily habits drastically. one of them, for example, is that i no longer need to get properly dressed in the morning before heading off into a place with other humans that i worked with. this has meant i have been able to slip further and further away from what most would consider suitable clothes for the outside world.
        </p>
        <p>
            now i never went as far as working in my pyjamas or underwear. but i definitely started to put less and less effort into what i wore whilst working from home. i opted for comfier clothes, optimising for function over fashion. and most would agree this is actually a perk of working from home. joggers (or jogging trousers to some people) are the ultimate in leg comfort. they're stretchy, soft, and can be both cool in summer and warm in winter. they're the perfect utility pant in my opinion.
        </p>
        <p>
            but in opting for comfy clothing like joggers, i think lost something. i can't quite put my finger on what. but there's a mental switch that gets flicked as soon as i put jeans or trousers on. there's an attitude change that occurs when i shave and do my hair. it made me feel more awake, attentive, engaged and generally less slobbish. it also helped with the separation between work and home as at the end of the day i could change back into my comfy clothes and that marked the end of the official work day.
        </p>
        <p>
            so with that i decided to make a resolution this year to get properly dressed each day regardless of where i am working. i decided to put the joggers away.
